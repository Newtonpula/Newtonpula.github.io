Different cell types have different amplitudes and timeconstants. The inhibitory neurons are typically faster, with a smallertime constant than the excitatory neurons, suggesting we coulddiscriminate between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in terms of theshape of <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(t)\)</span>. When we takeinto account the spike-afterpotential, discrimination of cell types ismuch improved. The shape of <span class="math inline">\(\eta(t)\)</span>in inhibitory cells is very different than that in excitatory ones.</p><p>While the spike-afterpotential is a monotonically decreasing functionin the excitatory cells, in the inhibitory cells the function <spanclass="math inline">\(\eta(t)\)</span> is better fitted by twoexponentials of opposite polarity. Spike afterpotential of inhibitoryneurons has an oscillatory component.</p><p>If we set <span class="math inline">\(\kappa(s)=(1/C)\exp(-s/\tau_m)\)</span>, we can take the derivative of (11.1) and write itin the form of <span class="math display">\[    C\frac{\mathrm{d}u(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\frac{1}{R}(u-u_{rest})+\sum_{f}^{}\tilde{\eta}(t-t^{(f)})+I^{ext}(t) \tag{11.2}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\eta}\)</span> is thetime course of the net current triggered after a spike.</p><p>After every spike the total current that can charge the membranecapacitance is <span class="math display">\[    C\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}t} \propto\eta_{C}(t-\hat{t})(u-E_{rev}) \tag{11.3}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{C}\)</span> is thespike triggered change in conductance and <spanclass="math inline">\(E_{rev}\)</span> its reversal potential.

Once the function <spanclass="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span> is expanded in a linearcombination of basis functions, maximizing the likelihood (10.40) can bedone through a convex gradient descent.</p><p>Dynamic threshold is not necessary for some neurons. The threshold inthose cells is constant in time. However, the excitatory cells have astrongly moving threshold which is characterized by at least two decaytime constants. Inactivation of sodium channels is a likely candidatefor the biophysical causes of a moving threshold.</p><p>GLMs predict more than 80 percent of the 'predictable' spikes. Somecells were predicted better than others such that the <spanclass="math inline">\(M\)</span> reached up to 95%. Other optimizationmethods but with similar models could improve the spike timingprediction of inhibitory neurons, reaching up to <spanclass="math inline">\(M\)</span>=100% for some cells. However,optimizing a GLM model with refractory effects but no adaptation reducesthe prediction performance by 20-30%, for both the excitatory andinhibitory cortical cells. A single spike has a measurable effect morethan 10 seconds after the action potential has occurred. Thus,adaptation is not characterized by a single time scale and shows up as apower-law decay in both spike-triggered current and threshold.</p><h2 id="encoding-models-in-systems-neuronscience">Encoding Models inSystems Neuronscience</h2><h3 id="receptive-fields-and-linear-nonlinear-poisson-model">Receptivefields and Linear-Nonlinear Poisson Model</h3><p>For a two-dimensional image, we label all pixels with a single index<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.

Thus only one dictionarylookup is needed. However, the algorithm presented above uses twolookups, one for the first character, and a later one for the entirestring. Why not use just one lookup for greater efficiency? &gt;&gt;There is a special case illustrated by the transmission of code 271in this example, where the string corresponding to the received code isnot complete. The first character can be found but then before theentire string is retrieved, the entry must be completed. This happenswhen a character or a string appears for the first time three times in arow, and is therefore rare. The algorithm above works correctly, at acost of an extra lookup that is seldom needed and may slow the algorithmdown.</p><h2 id="detail-2-d-discrete-cosine-transformation">Detail: 2-D DiscreteCosine Transformation</h2><h3 id="discrete-linear-transformation">Discrete LinearTransformation</h3><h3 id="discrete-cosine-transformation">Discrete CosineTransformation</h3><p>这部分看TimothySauer的数值分析p409-p449，但注意这本书的DFT插值好像有非常大的问题.</p><h1 id="errors">Errors</h1><h2 id="extension-of-system-model">Extension of System Model</h2><p>Extend the model for information handling to include "channelcoding."

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-heat-equation">The Heat Equation</h1><h2 id="derivation-of-the-heat-equation">Derivation of the heatequation</h2><p>Consider an infinite metal plate which we model as the plane <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)</span>, and suppose we are givenan initial heat distribution at time <spanclass="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. Let the temperature at the point<span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> at time <spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span> be denoted by <spanclass="math inline">\(u(x,y,t)\)</span>.</p><p>Consider a small square centered at <spanclass="math inline">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> with sides parallel to the axisand of side length <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. The amount ofheat energy in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at time <spanclass="math inline">\(t\)</span> is given by <spanclass="math display">\[    H(t)= \sigma \iint_{S} u(x,y,t) \mathrm{d}x \mathrm{d}y,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma&gt;0\)</span> is aconstant called the specific heat of the material. Therefore, the heatflow into <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is <spanclass="math display">\[    \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}= \sigma \iint_{S} \frac{\partialu}{\partial t} \mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}y,\]</span> which is approximately equal to <span class="math display">\[    \sigma h^{2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x_0,y_0,t),\]</span> since the area of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is<span class="math inline">\(h^{2}\)</span>. Now we apply Newton's law ofcooling, which states that heat flows from the higher to lowertemperature at a rate proportional to the difference, that is, thegradient.</p><p>The heat flow through the vertical side on the right is therefore<span class="math display">\[    - \kappa h \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (x_0+\frac{h}{2},y_0,t),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\kappa&gt;0\)</span> is theconductivity of the material. A similar argument for the other sidesshows that the total heat flow through the square <spanclass="math inline">\(S\)</span> is given by <spanclass="math display">\[    \kappa h \left[ \frac{\partial u}{\partialx}(x_0+\frac{h}{2},y_0,t)- \frac{\partial u}{\partialx}(x_0-\frac{h}{2},y_0,t)+\frac{\partial u}{\partialy}(x_0,y_0+\frac{h}{2},t)-\frac{\partial u}{\partialy}(x_0,y_0-\frac{h}{2},t)\right].\]</span> Applying the mean value theorem and letting <spanclass="math inline">\(h\)</span> tend to zero, we find that <spanclass="math display">\[    \frac{\sigma}{\kappa} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}= \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+ \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}};\]</span> this is called the <strong>time-dependent heatequation</strong>, often abbreviated to the heat equation.</p><h2 id="steady-state-heat-equation-in-the-disc">Steady-state heatequation in the disc</h2><p>After a long period of time, there is no more heat exchange, so thatthe system reaches thermal equilibrium and <spanclass="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partialt}=0\)</span>. In this case, the time-dependent heat equation reduces tothe <strong>steady-state heat equation</strong> <spanclass="math display">\[    \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partialy^{2}}=0. \tag{1}\]</span> The operator <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle\frac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial ^{2}}{\partialy^{2}}\)</span> is of such importance in mathematics and physics that itis often abbreviated as <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> andgiven a name: the Laplace operator or <strong>Laplacian</strong>. So thesteady-state heat equation is written as <span class="math display">\[    \Delta u=0,\]</span> and solutions to this equation are called <strong>harmonicfunctions</strong>.</p><p>Consider the unit disc in the plane <span class="math display">\[    D=\{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^{2}\colon x^{2}+y^{2}&lt;1\},\]</span> whose boundary is the unit circle <spanclass="math inline">\(C\)</span>. In polar coordinates <spanclass="math inline">\((r,\theta)\)</span>, with <spanclass="math inline">\(0\leqslant r\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(0\leqslant \theta&lt;2\pi\)</span>, we have <spanclass="math display">\[    D=\{(r,\theta) \colon 0\leqslant r&lt;1\} \quad\text{and} \quadC=\{(r,\theta)\colon r=1\}.\]</span> The problem. often called the <strong>Dirichletproblem</strong> (for the Laplacian on the unit disc), is to solve thesteady-state heat equation in the unit disc subject to the boundarycondition <span class="math inline">\(u=f\)</span> on <spanclass="math inline">\(C\)</span>. This corresponds to fixing apredetermined temperature distribution on the circle, waiting a longtime, and then looking at the temperature distribution inside thedisc.</p><p>While the method of separation of variables will turn out to beuseful for equation (1), a difficulty comes from the fact that theboundary condition is not easily expressed in terms of rectangularcoordinates. Since this boundary condition is best described by thecoordinates <span class="math inline">\((r,\theta)\)</span>, namely<span class="math inline">\(u(1,\theta)=f(\theta)\)</span>, we rewritethe Laplacian in polar coordinates. An application of the chain rulegives: <span class="math display">\[    \Delta u= \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial r^{2}}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial u}{\partial r}+\frac{1}{r^{2}} \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial \theta^{2}}.\]</span> We now multiply both sides by <spanclass="math inline">\(r^{2}\)</span>, and since <spanclass="math inline">\(\Delta u=0\)</span>, we get <spanclass="math display">\[    r^{2}\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial r^{2}}+r\frac{\partialu}{\partial r}=-\frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial \theta^{2}}.\]</span> Separating these variables, and looking for a solution of theform <span class="math inline">\(u(r,\theta)=F(r)G(\theta)\)</span>, wefind <span class="math display">\[    \frac{r^{2}F&#39;&#39;(r)+rF&#39;(r)}{F(r)}=-\frac{G&#39;&#39;(\theta)}{G(\theta)}.\]</span> Since the two sides depend on different variables, they mustboth be constant, say equal to <spanclass="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. We therefore get the followingequations: <span class="math display">\[    \begin{cases}        G&#39;&#39;(\theta)+\lambda G(\theta)=0, \\        r^{2} F&#39;&#39;(r)+rF&#39;(r)-\lambda F(r)=0.    \end{cases}\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> must be periodicof period <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>, this implies that<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\geqslant 0\)</span> and (as we haveseen before) that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=m^{2}\)</span>where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is an integer; hence <spanclass="math display">\[    G(\theta)= \tilde{A} \mathrm{e}^{im\theta} +\tilde{B}\mathrm{e}^{-im\theta} .\]</span> An application of Euler's identity, <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathrm{e}^{ix} =\cos x+ i \sin x\)</span>, allowsone to rewrite <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in terms ofcomplex exponentials, <span class="math display">\[    G(\theta)= A \mathrm{e}^{im\theta} +B \mathrm{e}^{-im \theta} .\]</span></p><p>With <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=m^{2}\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(m\neq 0\)</span>, two simple solution of theequation in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are <spanclass="math inline">\(F(r)=r^{m}\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(F(r)=r^{-m}\)</span>. If <spanclass="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>, then <spanclass="math inline">\(F(r)=1\)</span> and <spanclass="math inline">\(F(r)=\log r\)</span> are two solutions. If <spanclass="math inline">\(m&gt;0\)</span>, we note that <spanclass="math inline">\(r^{-m}\)</span> grows unboundedly large as <spanclass="math inline">\(r\)</span> tends to zero, so <spanclass="math inline">\(F(r)G(\theta)\)</span> is unbounded at theoriginl; the same occurs when <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span>and <span class="math inline">\(F(r)= \log r\)</span>.

Infact, one observes that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> isindefinitely differentiable. Note that 2 is an immediate consequence ofCorollary 1.7. Finally, by Plancherel's formula, we have <spanclass="math display">\[    \begin{aligned}        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert u(x,t)-f(x) \rvert ^{2}\mathrm{d}x &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert\hat{u}(\xi,t)-\hat{f}(\xi) \rvert ^{2} \mathrm{d}\xi \\        &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert \hat{f}(\xi) \rvert ^{2}\lvert \mathrm{e}^{-4\pi^{2}t \xi^{2}} -1 \rvert ^{2} \mathrm{d}\xi.    \end{aligned}\]</span></p><p>To see that this last integral goes to <spanclass="math inline">\(0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(t \to0\)</span>, we argue as follows: since <spanclass="math inline">\(\lvert \mathrm{e}^{-4\pi^{2}t \xi ^{2}} -1 \rvert\leqslant 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R})\)</span>, we can find <spanclass="math inline">\(N\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[    \int_{\lvert \xi \rvert \geqslant N}^{} \lvert \hat{f}(\xi) \rvert^{2}\lvert \mathrm{e}^{-4\pi^{2}t \xi^{2}} -1 \rvert  \mathrm{d}\xi&lt;\varepsilon,\]</span> and for all small <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> wehave <span class="math inline">\(\sup_{\lvert \xi \rvert \leqslantN}\lvert \hat{f}(\xi) \rvert ^{2}\lvert \mathrm{e}^{-4\pi^{2}t \xi^{2}}-1 \rvert ^{2}&lt;\varepsilon/2N\)</span> since <spanclass="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> is bounded. Thus <spanclass="math display">\[    \int_{\lvert \xi \rvert \leqslant N}^{} \lvert \hat{f}(\xi) \rvert^{2}\lvert \mathrm{e}^{-4\pi^{2}t \xi^{2}} -1 \rvert ^{2} \mathrm{d}\xi&lt; \varepsilon \quad \text{for all small}\ t.     \]</span> This completes the proof of the theorem.</p><h2 id="the-steady-state-heat-equation-in-the-upper-half-plane">Thesteady-state heat equation in the upper half-plane</h2><p>The equation we are now concerned with is <spanclass="math display">\[    \Delta u= \frac{\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial y^{2}}=0  \tag{13}\]</span> in the upper half-plane <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}=\{(x, y)\colon x\in\mathbb{R},y&gt;0\}\)</span>.

48位，理论上唯一网络标识，烧录在网卡，不便更改 - 流量控制，避免淹没（overwhelming）当快速的发送端遇上慢速的接收端，接收端缓存溢出 -共享信道上的访问控制（MAC）：同一个信道，同时传输信号。如同：同一间教室内，多人同时发言，需要纪律来控制。</p><p>网络层（Network Layer） - <strong>将数据包跨越网络从源设备发送到目的设备（host to

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="ascoli-arzela-theorem">Ascoli-Arzela Theorem</h1><p>Ascoli-Arzela定理在分析的多门课中都有用到：数分中作为一个函数项级数中的重要定理给出；ODE中用它来证明解的存在和唯一性定理；复分析中用它来证明Montel定理，从而证明RiemannMapping Theorem；调和分析中用它来证明Peter-WeylTheorem；在泛函分析中......</p><p>趁着脑子清醒，把以前记的相关结果记录一下，主要参考北京某高校数分三的笔记。这一节的标题为“紧集上的连续函数空间”主要是想证明如下定理：</p><p><strong>Theorem (Ascoli-Arzela)</strong>: 设 <spanclass="math inline">\(D \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span>是一个紧集，<spanclass="math inline">\(\mathcal{F} \subset C(D)\)</span>， 则 <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>完全有界 <spanclass="math inline">\(\iff\)</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> 有界且等度连续.</p><p>它回答了这样一个问题：<spanclass="math inline">\(C(D)\)</span>中什么样的集合是紧的？</p><p>解释一下概念： <strong>$C(D) $</strong> <spanclass="math inline">\(D\)</span>上连续函数构成的空间，其中 <spanclass="math inline">\(D\)</span>作为紧集可以是有限子集、有界闭区域或者紧子流形.</p><p><strong>（逐点）等度连续</strong>：<spanclass="math inline">\(\forall x_0 \in D, \forall \varepsilon&gt;0,\exists \delta&gt;0, \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, \forall \lvertx-x_0 \rvert &lt;\delta,(\lvert f(x)-f(x_0) \rvert&lt;\varepsilon)\)</span></p><p>一致等度连续就是上面定义中的 <spanclass="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>不依赖于 <spanclass="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>的选取</p><p>规定 <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>上的范数：<spanclass="math inline">\(\lVert \cdot \rVert \colon C(D) \to \mathbb{R}, f\mapsto \max_{x \in D} \lvert f(x) \rvert\)</span>，易见 <spanclass="math inline">\(C(D)\)</span>中函数列按由该范数诱导的度量定义的收敛性即为一致收敛性.由此得到</p><p><strong>定理</strong>：<spanclass="math inline">\(C(D)\)</span>是一个Banach空间.</p><p><strong>证</strong>：<spanclass="math inline">\(C(D)\)</span>中的Cauchy列 <spanclass="math inline">\(\{f_n\}\)</span>按上度量（一致）收敛到某个 <spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>，易知 <spanclass="math inline">\(f\)</span>连续，故属于 <spanclass="math inline">\(C(D)\)</span>.</p><p>在一般的完备度量空间上，紧与列紧等价，但是有界闭的条件太弱了，可以从<span class="math inline">\(f_n(x)=x^{n}, x \in[0,1]\)</span>得出，有界闭并不与列紧等价.</p><p>下面总假设 <spanclass="math inline">\((X,d_{X})\)</span>是一个完备度量空间，<spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>是 <spanclass="math inline">\(X\)</span>的一个子集.</p><p><strong>Lemma 1</strong>：<span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>紧<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>列紧. <strong>证</strong>：设 <spanclass="math inline">\(\{x_k\}\)</span>是 <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>中的点列，反证法：考虑 <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>的像 <spanclass="math inline">\(F\)</span>. <spanclass="math inline">\(F\)</span>为有限集的情况是易证的；对于 <spanclass="math inline">\(F\)</span>为无限集的情况，考虑 <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>中每个点与 <spanclass="math inline">\(F\)</span>交只为有限集的球领域，所有这些球领域构成<spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>的开覆盖，则它的任意有限子覆盖只能覆盖<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>的有限个点，总有 <spanclass="math inline">\(F\)</span>中的点不被盖到，这与 <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>的紧性矛盾！</p><p><strong>Lemma 2</strong>： <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>列紧<span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>紧 在给出证明前先做一些准备工作</p><p><strong>定义</strong>：若对任意的 <spanclass="math inline">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>，存在 <spanclass="math inline">\(E\)</span>中的有限点集 <spanclass="math

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="高阶微分方程">高阶微分方程</h1><p>首先各未知函数微商的最高阶数之和叫作该微分方程的<strong>阶</strong>，它可以部分反应求解的难度.因此降阶是非常重要的一步.</p><h2 id="几个例子">几个例子</h2><p>不明显包含自变量的方程叫作<strong>自治</strong>（或<strong>驻定</strong>）的，对它们可以进行降阶.例如，考虑n阶的自治微分方程 <span class="math display">\[    F\biggl(y,\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x},\cdots,\frac{\mathrm{d}^ny}{\mathrm{d}x^n}\biggr)=0 \tag{1}\]</span> 令 <spanclass="math inline">\(z=\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\)</span>，则有关系式<span class="math display">\[    \begin{cases}        \displaystyle        \frac{\mathrm{d}^2y}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y}\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=z\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y}\\        \displaystyle        \frac{\mathrm{d}^3y}{\mathrm{d}x^3}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\biggl(z\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y}\biggr)=z^2\frac{\mathrm{d}^2z}{\mathrm{d}y^2}+z        \biggl(\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y}\biggr) \\        \cdots \\        \displaystyle        \frac{\mathrm{d}^ny}{\mathrm{d}x^n}=\varphi\biggl(z,\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y},\cdots,\frac{\mathrm{d}^{n-1}z}{\mathrm{d}y^{n-1}}\biggr)    \end{cases}\]</span> 然后，把它们代入（1），就得到一个 <spanclass="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>阶的微分方程 <spanclass="math display">\[    F_1\biggl(y,z,\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}y},\cdots,\frac{\mathrm{d}^{n-1}z}{\mathrm{d}y^{n-1}}\biggr)=0\]</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>是未知函数，而<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>是自变量.</p><p>与之相关有<strong>轨线</strong>、<strong>相平面</strong>、<strong>相图</strong>的概念.【例1】<strong>单摆方程</strong>：直接给出要解的微分方程 <spanclass="math

\]</span>把这种由高阶微分方程积分一次得到的关系式称为<strong>首次积分</strong>继续解该方程得到通积分，包含椭圆函数，可以利用 <spanclass="math inline">\(\sin x \thickapproxx\)</span>，接下去变成物理中的推导，略.</p><p>【例2】<strong>悬链线方程</strong>：在数学分析中，已经用变分法求得了悬链线的方程（摆线），这里可以从微分方程的角度再看一下（其实也是类似的）.直接给出要解的微分方程 <span class="math display">\[    y&#39;&#39;=a

这是一个<strong>边值问题</strong>. 令 <spanclass="math inline">\(z=y&#39;\)</span>可以降为一阶微分方程 <spanclass="math display">\[    z&#39;=a \sqrt{1+z^{2}}\]</span> 而且它是变量分离的. 容易求出它的通解 <spanclass="math display">\[    z= \sinh a(x+C_1)\]</span> 其中 <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span>是一个任意常数.由此再积分得到通解<br /><span class="math display">\[    y=\frac{1}{a} \cosh a(x+C_1) +C_2 \tag{4}\]</span> 其中 <spanclass="math

最终答案是一个双曲余弦函数.问题此时还没有完全解决.还需要利用悬链线的长度解曲线积分，利用边值条件的高度差求解常数.</p><p>【例3】<strong>二体问题</strong>：由Newton'sLaw得到一个6阶的微分方程组，可以推出运动的轨道永远在一个平面上，不妨设为平面<span class="math inline">\(z=0\)</span>. 此时降为一个4阶方程.以下求解过程略.</p><h2 id="n维线性空间中的微分方程">n维线性空间中的微分方程</h2><p>设 <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>阶微分方程 <spanclass="math display">\[

<spanclass="math inline">\(I\)</span>上一致收敛.注意用Lipschitz条件作指数型估计.证明唯一性也运用Lipschitz条件迭代得到.</p><p>有了Picard定理，对于一般微分方程 <span class="math display">\[    \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=f(x, y)

class="math inline">\(D\)</span>内经过每一点有并且只有一个解.</p><p><strong>Osgood 条件</strong>：设函数 <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span>在区域 <spanclass="math inline">\(G\)</span>内连续，而且满足不等式 <spanclass="math

<spanclass="math inline">\(R\)</span>内的连续性，那么利用Euler折线仍可证明初值问题<span class="math inline">\((E)\)</span>的解在区间 <spanclass="math inline">\(\left\vert x-x_0 \right\vert

inline">\(h\)</span>的定义同定理3.1.</p><p><strong>证</strong>：用引理3.1取一个一致收敛的子函数列，再用引理3.2取<span class="math inline">\(k \to \infty\)</span>即可.</p><p><strong>反例</strong>：若不要求 <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span>的连续性，那么上面的初值问题 <spanclass="math inline">\((E)\)</span>可能是无解的. 例如，设函数 <spanclass="math display">\[    f^*(x, y)=    \begin{cases}        1,\qquad 1\leqslant \left\vert x+y \right\vert &lt;\infty \\        (-1)^{n}, \qquad \frac{1}{n+1}\leqslant \left\vert x+y\right\vert \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \quad (n=1,2,\cdots ) \\        0, \qquad \left\vert x+y \right\vert =0
